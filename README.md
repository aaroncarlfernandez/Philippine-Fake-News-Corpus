# Philippine-Fake-News-Corpus
Philippine Fake News Corpus for my Master's Thesis entitled *"Computing the Linguistic-Based Cues of Fake News in the Philippines Towards its Detection"*

This dataset contains **14,802** *"Credible" news* and **7,656** *"Not Credible" news*, all of which had its headline and news content cleaned from any atached bylines or other forms of metdata (e.g. *"Like Share Subscribe", "Like us on Faceook", "Manila, Philippines - "*) that may had been included during the scraping.

**"Credible" news** are all hard news under the "Nation" category of Philippine's national broadsheets: *Philippine Daily Inquirer, Manila Bulletin, and The Manila Times*.

**"Not Credible" news** were harvested from *Adobo Chronicles, GR Pundit, Get Real Philippines, VerifiedPH, Pinoy Trending Altervista, Pinoy Trending News, Thinking Pinoy, Duterte Today, Pinoy News Blogger, Pilipinas Online Updates, Hot News Philippines, News Media Philippines, and Philippine News Courier*. These were all cited as a "Fake News" source by the <a href="http://verafiles.org/articles/aquino-list-shows-many-fake-news-sites-bear-dutertes-name" target="_blank">**Philippine Senate**</a>, <a href="https://cmfr-phil.org/in-context/knowing-your-source-think-before-you-click/" target="_blank">**Center for Media Freedom & Responsibility**</a> and <a href="http://www.cbcplaiko.org/2017/01/31/appendix-ii-partial-list-of-web-news-blog-sites-in-the-philippines-with-fake-or-unverified-content/" target="_blank">**Catholic Bishop's Conference in the Philippines**</a>
